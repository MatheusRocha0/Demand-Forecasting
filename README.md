In this project, I built a Machine Learning model able to forecast the demand for gasoline in the United States for the next 24 weeks.

## Summary

• Problem Statement

• Business Understanding

• Data Collection

• Data Cleaning

• Time Series Analysis

• ARIMA model

• Evaluation Metrics

• Forecasting

• Deploy

## Tools

• Python 3.6.9

• Jupyter Notebook

• Pandas

• NumPy

• Seaborn

• Matplotlib

• Statsmodels

## Deploy 

In order to make the results more avaiable, I deployed this model as a Telegram Chatbot I called GasBot (@gasforecasting_bot). Anyone may access it and see the results. 

The only thing you need to do is start a chat with it and enter "/return" and then it will return a plot with the predictions for the next weeks.
