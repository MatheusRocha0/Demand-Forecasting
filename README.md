# Demand Forecasting

In this project, I built a statistical model able to forecast the demand for gasoline in the United States for the next 24 weeks.

# Deploy 

In order to make the results more visible, I deployed this model as a Telegram Chatbot I called GasBot (@gasforecasting_bot). 

Anyone may access it and see the results. 

The only thing you need to do is start a chat with it and enter "/return" and then it will return a plot with the predictions for the next weeks.
